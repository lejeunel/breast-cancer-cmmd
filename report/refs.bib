abstract = {Breast cancer is a disease in which the cells of the breast develop unnaturally and uncontrollably, resulting in a mass called a tumor. If lumps in the breast are not addressed, they can spread to other regions of the body, including the bones, liver, and lungs. Men and women are both affected by breast cancer, albeit men are at a lower risk. This research investigates the detection of breast cancer by applying machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and hybrid machine learning approaches to a variety of datasets. These datasets include breast cancer databases from Wisconsin as well as mammography imaging datasets. The goal of this research is to find the best model for breast cancer diagnosis.}

ABSTRACT = {Breast cancer is one of the precarious conditions that affect women, and a substantive cure has not yet been discovered for it. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients’ survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the field. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study specifically adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identified. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area.},
