#+title: A Deep-Learning Approach to Breast Cancer Screening from Mammography Images

* Installation

- Install [[https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation][Poetry]] in user-space.
- move to project's root and install project with:

#+begin_src shell
poetry install
#+end_src

This will look for an existing and activated virtual environment, and create one
in current directory if it does not exist.



* Usage & Configuration

We provide a ~Dockerfile~ along with a ~Makefile~ to facilitate reproducibility and
abstract-away some pipeline steps.

Prior to run targets, you may setup environment variables:
- ~HMTEST_RUN_DIR~: Where model weights and intermediate validation data will be stored.
- ~HMTEST_DATA_DIR~: Where raw-data and meta-data are stored.

If not set, these directories will be automatically created in project's root.

- TODO: Set permission of files generated from docker container. They are now ~root:root~
