#+title: A Deep-Learning Approach to Breast Cancer Screening from Mammography Images

* Usage & Configuration

- Install [[https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation][Poetry]] in user-space.
- move to project's root and install project with:

#+begin_src shell
poetry install
#+end_src

This will look for an existing and activated virtual environment, and create one
in current directory if it does not exist.

We make available a serie of CLI endpoints to execute the different phases of
our pipeline. The root endpoint is documented at:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py --help
#+end_src

** Pipeline Steps

*** Selecting Series and Merging Annotations

We provide a base meta-data file that contains references to the original CMMD dataset at
~assets/meta.csv~.
Remove rows from this file prior to running the next commands to discard
patients.

First, we merge our base meta-data file with annotations with:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py cmmd merge-meta-and-annotations assets/meta.csv assets/annotations.csv <data-dir>/meta-annotated.csv
#+end_src

*** Downloading Raw-data

The raw DICOM files are publicly available on ~cancerimagingarchive.net~.
We provide a routine to download these. We recommend setting ~n-threads~
to >16 to accelerate download time.

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py cmmd fetch-raw-data -w <n-threads> <data-dir>/meta-annotated.csv <data-dir>/dicom
#+end_src

*** Parse DICOM series
Next, we parse each dicom file to obtain some relevant meta-data:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py cmmd build-per-image-meta <data-dir>/meta-annotated.csv <data-dir>/meta-images.csv
#+end_src

*** Convert images

We convert each image to 8-bit in PNG format:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py cmmd dicom-to-png <data-dir>/meta-images.csv <data-dir>/dicom <data-dir>/png
#+end_src

*** Making train/val/test Splits
Last, we construct training, validation, and testing splits with:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py ml split <data-dir>/meta-images.csv <data-dir>/meta-images-split.csv 0.2 0.2
#+end_src

** Training

All our models can be trained using commands of the following form:

#+begin_src shell
python hmtest/main.py ml train --cuda --fusion <fusion-mode> --lfabnorm <lfa> --lftype <lft> <data-dir>/meta-images-split.csv <data-dir>/png <run-dir> <experiment-name>
#+end_src

Where:
- ~<fusion-mode>~ sets the fusion strategy.
- ~<lfabnorm>~ is the loss factor applied to the multi-label abnormality classification objective.
- ~<lftype>~ is the loss factor applied to the tumor type classification objective.
- ~<run-dir>~ is the root path where checkpoints, logs, and validation data will be stored.
- ~<experiment-name>~ sets the name of the directory created in ~<run-dir>~.

* Docker Container

We provide a ~Dockerfile~ along with a ~Makefile~ to facilitate reproducibility and
abstract-away the granular pipeline steps described above.

Prior to run targets, you may customize the following environment variables.
Please refer to the above section to understand their meaning.
- ~HMTEST_RUN_DIR~
- ~HMTEST_DATA_DIR~

** TODO
- TODO: Set permission of files generated from docker container. They are now ~root:root~

** Questions / Next steps
- /The result of the experiments shall be reusable and sharable metrics/: Is this a typo? Does this simply means to generate a predictions on the test set and distribute these as a csv file?
- /We might not need or be able to download the whole dataset so your code should be allow to process a portion of it./
- Investigate on effect of adding classification task on type of abnormality.
- /You are expected to use a code repository (private gitlab or github repository is fine) and commit the code carefully./
